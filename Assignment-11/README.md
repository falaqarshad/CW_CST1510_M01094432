# Unified Intelligence Platform – CST1510 CW2

## Overview
This project is a Multi-Domain Intelligence Platform built using Python and Streamlit.
It provides analytics and decision support for three domains:
- Cybersecurity
- Data Science
- IT Operations

The system demonstrates database usage, OOP design, visual analytics, authentication,
and AI-assisted insights.

## Domains Implemented (Tier 3)

### 1. Cybersecurity – Incident Response Analysis
**Problem:** Phishing incidents are increasing, causing resolution delays.  
**Solution:**
- Incident dashboard with severity and status
- Identification of phishing bottlenecks
- Visualisation of incident trends
- Actionable response recommendations

---

### 2. Data Science – Dataset Governance
**Problem:** Growing datasets require governance and storage management.  
**Solution:**
- Dataset catalog with size, rows, and source
- Resource consumption analysis
- Governance recommendations (archiving & policy decisions)
- Visual dataset comparison

---

### 3. IT Operations – Service Desk Performance
**Problem:** Slow ticket resolution and uneven staff workload.  
**Solution:**
- Ticket overview dashboard
- Bottleneck detection by status
- Staff workload analysis
- Management recommendations for optimisation

---

## AI Assistant
An integrated AI Assistant provides intelligent, domain-aware insights.
It responds to questions about:
- Cybersecurity incidents
- Dataset governance
- IT service desk performance

This satisfies the AI integration requirement for Tier 3.
